Evmpeek CLI includes tools for disassembling and decompiling smart contract bytecode.

Disassembly is the process of breaking down machine code into human-readable assembly code, which can help developers to better understand how the code works and identify potential issues. Evmpeek CLI includes a disassembler that can be used to convert EVM bytecode into assembly code.

Decompilation is the process of converting compiled code back into its original source code, which can be helpful for debugging and analysis. Evmpeek CLI includes a decompiler that can be used to convert EVM bytecode into high-level Solidity code.

These tools can be particularly useful for developers who are working with smart contracts on EVM-based blockchains, as they provide a way to analyze and understand the code that is running on the blockchain. By disassembling and decompiling smart contract bytecode, developers can better understand how contracts work, identify potential issues, and debug more effectively.

Overall, Evmpeek CLI is a powerful toolkit that includes a wide range of tools for working with smart contracts on EVM-based blockchains, including disassembly and decompilation tools that can be particularly helpful for developers.
